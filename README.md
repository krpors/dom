# DOM Level 3 for Go

Experimental attempt for a complete implementation of the DOM, level 3,
using the specs [from W3.org](https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-DOM-Level-3-Core-20040407/core.html#i-Document),
in the Go language.

There are several other implementations floating about. This is currently just
an experiment to see how far I can get, and perhaps it can grow into a usable
implementation.
